# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

**Objectives:**

* Popular language Data Scientist List
* Data Science Libraries List
* Data Science Tools List

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. PHYTON
2. SQL 
3. R 
4. VBA 
5. JULIA

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. TensorFlow
2. NumPy

 Define the header
header = "Data Science Tools"

# Define rows
row1 = "JUPYTER NOTEBOOK"
row2 = "TABLEAU"
row3 = "APACHE SPARK"

# Separator line
separator = "-" * len(header)
print(header)
print(separator)

# Print rows
print(row1)
print(row2)
print(row3)

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
 b=(3*4)+5
 print(b)

#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
#t in minutes
t=200
#h in hours
h=t/60
#print result
print(h)
